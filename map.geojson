    "description":"Our story in the Shahnama begins with the reign of Yazdegerd I who was a  Sasanian king of kings, also known as the shahanshah. According to historical records, he reigned from the year 399 CE to 420 CE. His significance in this story is not his reign, but rather his death in 420. His assassination left a vacuum in power. The Persian court determined that none of Yazdegerd’s sons deserved to have the throne so they elected to have Khusrau, a noble,  as the new king. One of Yazdegerd’s sons, Bahram opposed this decision and confronted the court with the support of a Lakhmid, Arabic army. According to the legend told in the Shahnameh, he challenged the elected noble, Khusrau, to a trial where the crown would be placed between two lions and the first to retrieve the crown would be the new Shahanshah. Bahram goes on to win the challenge and the hearts and approval of the Persian court. Thus begins the reign of Bahram V, who is also known as Bahram Gur."},

    "description":"The crown on the ground is the prize of this challenge and its position between two aggressive lions is a challenge to test the courage and hunting skill of the two challengers. This crown is representative of rule over the entirety of the Sasanian kingdom. Its precarious position is a great allegory for the reality of the vacuum in power left behind by Yazdegerd I’s assassination. Bahram’s challenge to the crown is a daring attempt to reclaim power for his family lineage, especially so due to the noble court’s attempt to take away power from Yazdegerd’s sons by electing Khusrau in their place. Bahram’s arrival with the support of an Arab army is a display of his bravado and his challenge to Khusrau with the trial further emphasizes his bravery.  By setting up a life-or-death challenge, he forces Khusrau to choose between a bloody war between his kingdom and the Lakhmid army, or a daring challenge where both men risk their lives to claim the crown. The crown is representative of so much more than just the prestige. It is also representative of a gambit presented by Bahram to save needless bloodshed between his army and Khusrau’s army."},

    "description":"According to the Shahnama, Bahram brought two fierce lions with him when he arrived to challenge Khusrau’s throne and gave them to the high priest to set up an arena where the trial could take place. The handlers who dragged the lions into place are described as being extremely frightened of the fierce lions, who are now shown cowering in fear. This is a display of Bahram’s strong hunting skills. Bahram’s hunting prowess is well documented in folklore and certainly in the Shahnama. In this part of the image, the lions are shown cowering in fear from Bahram and his mace. Their turned faces indicate Bahram’s skilled hunting mastery over them, something which is commonly used in the Shahnama and other Persian stories as an indicator of great combat capabilities. Rustam, also in the Shahnama, is another example of a great warrior who is displayed as having amazing hunting prowess."},

    "description":"Khusrau is in awe of Bahram’s feat, raising his arms in shock and bringing one arm near his face in a display of surprise. While Khusrau and Bahram are rivals, this image displays that Bahram has earned the respect of Khusrau by completing the trial. At this point in the story, Khusrau had already withdrawn from the challenge and is witnessing Bahram attempt the trial. Khusrau’s style of dress represents his ruling status, much like Bahram’s does. Khusrau is depicted as wearing vibrant red and orange robes and a crown identical to Bharam’s. Such colorful and extravagant clothing are a clear indication of his kingly status. In comparison with Bahram’s clothing, they can be seen as equals. In the bigger picture, Khusrau and Bahram had equally high and mighty backings to support their claims to the throne. Khusrau had the backing of the Persian aristocracy and priesthood, while Bahram had the backing of the neighboring Lakhmid kingdom’s army. So by showing Khusrau looking on in awe of Bahram, the illustration is showing why Khusrau eventually conceded the throne."},

    "description":"The onlooking crowd is in awe of Bahram’s feat, much like Khusrau is. Two figures are shown peeking past a barrier of sorts, clearly interested in Bahram’s actions. Both figures are depicted with headwear, indicating elevated status over commoners. Thus, these two are likely members of the Persian court, aristocrats and priests. In fact, the peeping man on the right could very likely be wearing a headdress commonly worn by Zoroastrian priests, indicating his social status in the audience. Bahram’s public challenge was a major disruption to their plan to seize power by placing their favored aristocrat, Khusrau, in power. It is likely that had Khusrau stayed in power, the aristocrats and priesthood would have had much more sway over the Shah’s decisions. Thanks to Bahram’s daring challenge, Bahram has won over the hearts and minds of the court, as shown by the court members' interest."},

    "description":"According to the written story, Bahram bravely confronts the two fearsome lions with a bold stance and ox-head mace in hand. \“One on the instant snapped its chain and charged The exalted king. That hero smote its head; And dimmed its eyes, then going to the other; Smote its head whence the blood ran down its breast (Warner 1912, 410)\” From this excerpt from the translated Shahnameh, Bahram swiftly takes down both lions with ease. His weapon of choice, the ox-head mace, is also a weapon of war. As such, his prowess with a weapon of war is a signal of his battle skills. Since he was a young royal, Bahram was trained in the Lakhmid court in the various skills necessary for a potential heir to the throne, such as hunting and combat skills. Here, in a grand display in front of the Perian court and ruling shah, Khusrau, he gets to demonstrate his skills. These skills are a very convincing reason for the court and Khusrau to view Bahram as a capable and effective ruler."},

    "description":"Khusrau is also depicted with a set of weapons, though he never uses them during the challenge. He is shown with a quiver of arrows strapped to his waist, likely to be used against the lions, had he not withdrawn from the trial. This is a demonstration of the large difference in approach that each of the two challengers had towards killing the two lions. Armed with a bow and arrow, Khusrau would have had to strike down the lions from afar, likely out of harm’s reach since each lion was held down by chains. Khusrau’s approach would be viewed as significantly more cowardly by his court, and furthermore, he still withdraws from the challenges and cedes the arena to Bahram entirely. Each man’s weapon of choice draws a stark difference in their personality. Bahram is portrayed as the bold and tactical leader while Khusrau is portrayed as cowardly. Not only that, but the Persian court’s support for his rule is a testament to his weak character since they wanted to be able to increasingly sway the ruling Shah’s decisions."},

    "description":"Bahram’s garb is illustrated as detailed, fanciful, colorful, yet functional. The illustration has a great amount of details in the folds of the clothing, especially the scalloped pattern around his waist. There appear to be multiple layers of clothing, potentially indicating armor plating of some kind underneath the colorful, ornamental outer garb. His clothes also cover his entire body from neck down to the feet, showing that he, as a royal, is deserving of his status as such. The direct choice to put so much detail into Bahram’s clothing stresses the higher status of Bahram as the hero. Additionally, the green color of his clothing is worth drawing attention to. Green, in many Islamic cultures, has been connected to the Prophet Muhammad and Islam. Bahram’s green garb is a subtle way for the illustrator to display him in a more mythical hero status, rather than just another strong-willed courageous king. Additionally, the Shahnama describes Bahram as saying a prayer before his trial, and profusely thanking his Zoroastrian deity after his victory. Of course, it would not have been an Islamic prayer, as Bahram lived before the birth of the Prophet Muhammad. Though this was illustrated by Islamic artists, they show great respect for Bahram’s piety through the usage of green in filling in his clothing."},

    "description":"Each of the three crowns depicted is very similar to each other in size, shape, and colour. If you look closely, however, the crown on Bahram’s head and the crown between the two lions are identical. The gold outer rim of the crowns are identical rectangular shapes while Khusrau’s crown has slightly arch pointed segments. The tips of the two identical crowns are golden while Khusrau’s is black and white. Since both Khusrau and Bahram come from aristocratic backgrounds, the crowns on their heads are there to represent their existing status as royalty. The symbolism of the different  crowns is a clear indication of Bahram Gur’s new position as the winner of the challenge, and therefore the new Shah of Persia."},

    "description":"The Persian script accompanying this beautifully detailed  illustration is done in a style known as Nasta’liq script, the predominant style of Persian calligraphy in the 15th and 16th centuries. This style is known for extended horizontal strokes , bolder curved strokes and overall flowing style. As such, it is a very elegant script that is fitting for expensive, detailed manuscripts such as this version of the Shahnameh. Ibrahim Sultan, who sponsored this manuscript in the early 15th century, was a skilled calligrapher himself. While it is unlikely he wrote this page himself, it is possible that he had some part in writing this manuscript. In comparison with a copy of the Quran that he is known to have written himself, this page’s Nasta’liq script does not quite line up with Ibrahim Sultan’s own writing. Still, there is a possibility that he could have learned the stylistic differences in script by the time this manuscript was written."},
