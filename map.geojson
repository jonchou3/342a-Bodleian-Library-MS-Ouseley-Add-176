    "description":"Our story in the Shahnama begins with the reign of Yazdegerd I who was a  Sasanian king of kings, also known as the shahanshah. According to historical records, he reigned from the year 399 CE to 420 CE. His significance in this story is not his reign, but rather his death in 420. His assassination left a vacuum in power. The Persian court determined that none of Yazdegerd’s sons deserved to have the throne so they elected to have Khusrau, a noble,  as the new king. One of Yazdegerd’s sons, Bahram opposed this decision and confronted the court with the support of a Lakhmid, Arabic army. According to the legend told in the Shahnameh, he challenged the elected noble, Khusrau, to a trial where the crown would be placed between two lions and the first to retrieve the crown would be the new Shahanshah. Bahram goes on to win the challenge and the hearts and approval of the Persian court. Thus begins the reign of Bahram V, who is also known as Bahram Gur."},

    "description":"The crown on the ground is the prize of this challenge and its position between two aggressive lions is a challenge to test the courage and hunting skill of the two challengers. This crown is representative of rule over the entirety of the Sasanian kingdom. Its precarious position is a great allegory for the reality of the vacuum in power left behind by Yazdegerd I’s assassination. Bahram’s challenge to the crown is a daring attempt to reclaim power for his family lineage, especially so due to the noble court’s attempt to take away power from Yazdegerd’s sons by electing Khusrau in their place. Bahram’s arrival with the support of an Arab army is a display of his bravado and his challenge to Khusrau with the trial further emphasizes his bravery.  By setting up a life-or-death challenge, he forces Khusrau to choose between a bloody war between his kingdom and the Lakhmid army, or a daring challenge where both men risk their lives to claim the crown. The crown is representative of so much more than just the prestige. It is also representative of a gambit presented by Bahram to save needless bloodshed between his army and Khusrau’s army."},

    "description":"According to the Shahnama, Bahram brought two fierce lions with him when he arrived to challenge Khusrau’s throne and gave them to the high priest to set up an arena where the trial could take place. The handlers who dragged the lions into place are described as being extremely frightened of the fierce lions, who are now shown cowering in fear. This is a display of Bahram’s strong hunting skills. Bahram’s hunting prowess is well documented in folklore and certainly in the Shahnama. In this part of the image, the lions are shown cowering in fear from Bahram and his mace. Their turned faces indicate Bahram’s skilled hunting mastery over them, something which is commonly used in the Shahnama and other Persian stories as an indicator of great combat capabilities. Rustam, also in the Shahnama, is another example of a great warrior who is displayed as having amazing hunting prowess."},
